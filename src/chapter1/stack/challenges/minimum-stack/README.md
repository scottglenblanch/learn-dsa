Minimum Stack
Design a stack class that supports the push, pop, top, and getMin operations.

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
* void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
* void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
* int top() gets the top element of the stack.
* int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

Each function should run in O(1) time.
